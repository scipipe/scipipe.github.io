SciPipe also lets you restart an interrupted run without over-writing already produced output and produces an audit report of what was run, among many other things. SciPipe is built on the proven principles of Flow-Based Programming (FBP) to achieve maximum flexibility, productivity and agility when designing workflows. Compared to plain dataflow, FBP provides the benefits that processes are fully self-contained, so that a library of re-usable components can be created, and plugged into new workflows ad-hoc. Similar to other FBP systems, SciPipe workflows can be likened to a network of assembly lines in a factory, where items (files) are flowing through a network of conveyor belts, stopping at different independently running stations (processes) for processing, as depicted in the picture above. SciPipe was initially created for problems in bioinformatics and cheminformatics, but works equally well for any problem involving pipelines of commandline applications. Project status: SciPipe is still alpha software and minor breaking API changes still happens as we try to streamline the process of writing workflows. Please follow the commit history closely for any API updates if you have code already written in SciPipe (Let us know if you need any help in migrating code to the latest API). Known limitations There are still a number of missing good-to-have features for workflow design. See the issue tracker for details. There is not (yet) support for the Common Workflow Language . Installing Download and install Go Run the following command, to install the scipipe Go library (don't miss the trailing dots!): go get github.com/scipipe/scipipe/... Hello World example Let's look at an example workflow to get a feel for what writing workflows in SciPipe looks like: package main import ( // Import SciPipe, aliased to sp sp github.com/scipipe/scipipe ) func main () { // Init workflow and max concurrent tasks wf := sp . NewWorkflow ( hello_world , 4 ) // Initialize processes, and file extensions hello := wf . NewProc ( hello , echo Hello {o:out|.txt} ) world := wf . NewProc ( world , echo $(cat {i:in}) World {o:out|.txt} ) // Define data flow world . In ( in ). From ( hello . Out ( out )) // Run workflow wf . Run () } Running the example Let's put the code in a file named scipipe_helloworld.go and run it: $ go run hello_world.go AUDIT 2018 /06/15 19 :04:22 | workflow:hello_world | Starting workflow ( Writing log to log/scipipe-20180615-190422-hello_world.log ) AUDIT 2018 /06/15 19 :04:22 | hello | Executing: echo Hello hello.out.txt.tmp/hello.out.txt AUDIT 2018 /06/15 19 :04:22 | hello | Finished: echo Hello hello.out.txt.tmp/hello.out.txt AUDIT 2018 /06/15 19 :04:22 | world | Executing: echo $( cat hello.out.txt ) World hello.out.txt.world.out.txt.tmp/hello.out.txt.world.out.txt AUDIT 2018 /06/15 19 :04:22 | world | Finished: echo $( cat hello.out.txt ) World hello.out.txt.world.out.txt.tmp/hello.out.txt.world.out.txt AUDIT 2018 /06/15 19 :04:22 | workflow:hello_world | Finished workflow ( Log written to log/scipipe-20180615-190422-hello_world.log ) Let's check what file SciPipe has generated: $ ls -1 hello* hello.out.txt hello.out.txt.audit.json hello.out.txt.world.out.txt hello.out.txt.world.out.txt.audit.json As you can see, it has created a file hello.out.txt , and hello.out.world.out.txt , and an accompanying .audit.json for each of these files. Now, let's check the output of the final resulting file: $ cat hello.out.txt.world.out.txt Hello World Now we can rejoice that it contains the text \"Hello World\", exactly as a proper Hello World example should :) Now, these were a little long and cumbersome filename, weren't they? SciPipe gives you very good control over how to name your files, if you don't want to rely on the automatic file naming. For example, we could set the first filename statically, and then use the first name as a basis for the file name for the second process, like so: package main import ( // Import the SciPipe package, aliased to sp sp github.com/scipipe/scipipe ) func main () { // Init workflow with a name, and max concurrent tasks wf := sp . NewWorkflow ( hello_world , 4 ) // Initialize processes and set output file paths hello := wf . NewProc ( hello , echo Hello {o:out} ) hello . SetOut ( out , hello.txt ) world := wf . NewProc ( world , echo $(cat {i:in}) World {o:out} ) world . SetOut ( out , {i:in|%.txt}_world.txt ) // Connect network world . In ( in ). From ( hello . Out ( out )) // Run workflow wf . Run () } In the {i:in... part, we are re-using the file path from the file received on the in-port named 'in', and then running a Bash-style trim-from-end command on it to remove the .txt extension. Now, if we run this, the file names get a little cleaner: $ ls -1 hello* hello.txt hello.txt.audit.json hello_world.go hello_world.txt hello_world.txt.audit.json The audit logs Finally, we could have a look at one of those audit file created: $ cat hello_world.txt.audit.json { ID : 99i5vxhtd41pmaewc8pr , ProcessName : world , Command : echo $( cat hello.txt ) World \\u003e\\u003e hello_world.txt.tmp/hello_world.txt , Params : {} , Tags : {} , StartTime : 2018-06-15T19:10:37.955602979+02:00 , FinishTime : 2018-06-15T19:10:37.959410102+02:00 , ExecTimeNS : 3000000 , Upstream : { hello.txt : { ID : w4oeiii9h5j7sckq7aqq , ProcessName : hello , Command : echo Hello \\u003e hello.txt.tmp/hello.txt , Params : {} , Tags : {} , StartTime : 2018-06-15T19:10:37.950032676+02:00 , FinishTime : 2018-06-15T19:10:37.95468214+02:00 , ExecTimeNS : 4000000 , Upstream : {} } } Each such audit-file contains a hierarchic JSON-representation of the full workflow path that was executed in order to produce this file. On the first level is the command that directly produced the corresponding file, and then, indexed by their filenames, under \"Upstream\", there is a similar chunk describing how all of its input files were generated. This process will be repeated in a recursive way for large workflows, so that, for each file generated by the workflow, there is always a full, hierarchic, history of all the commands run - with their associated metadata - to produce that file.

Processes The probably most basic concept in SciPipe is the process. A process is an asynchronously running component that is typically defined as a static, \"long-running\" part of the workflow, and the number of processes thus is typically fixed for a workflow during its execution. One can create customized types of processes, but for most basic workflows, the scipipe.Process will be used, which is specialized for executing commandline applications. New Process -es are typically created using the scipipe.NewProc(procName, shellPattern) command. See GoDoc for Process Tasks The \"long-running\" processes mentioned above, will receive input files on its in-ports, and for each complete set of input files it receives, it will create a new task . Specifically, scipipe.Process will create scipipe.Task objects, and populate it with all data needed for one particular shell command execution. Task objects are executed via their Execute() method, or CustomExecute() , if custom Go code is supposed to be executed instead of a shell command. The distinction between processes and tasks is important to understand, for example when doing more advanced configuration of file naming strategies, since the custom anonymous functions used to format paths are taking a Task as input, even though these functions are saved on the process object. To understand the difference between processes and tasks, it is helpful to remember that processes are long-running, and typically fixed during the course of a workflow, while tasks are transient objects, created temporarily as a container for all data and code needed for each execution of a concrete shell command. See GoDoc for Task Ports Central to the way data dependencies are defined in SciPipe, is ports. Ports are fields on processes, which are connected to other ports via channels (see separate section on this page). In SciPipe, each port must have a unique name within its process (there can't be an in-port and out-port named the same), and this name will be used in shell command patterns, when connecting dependencies / dataflow networks, and when configuring file naming strategies. In Process objects, in-ports are are accessed with myProcess.In(\"my_port\") , and out-ports are similarly accessed with myProcess.Out(\"my_other_port\") . They are of type InPort and OutPort respectively. Some pre-made components might have ports bound to custom field names though, such as myFastaReader.InFastaFile , or myZipComponent.OutZipFile . Port objects have some methods bound to them, most importantly the From() method (for in-ports. Out-ports have a corresponding To() method), which takes another port, and connects to it, by stitching a channel between the ports. On Process objects, there is also a third port type, InParamPort (and the accompanying OutParamPort ), which is used when it is needed to send a stream of parameter values (in string format) to be supplied to as arguments to shell commands. See GoDoc for the InPort struct type See GoDoc for the OutPort struct type See GoDoc for the InParamPort struct type See GoDoc for the OutParamPort struct type Channels Ports in SciPipe are connected via channels. Channels are plain Go channels and nothing more. Most of the time, one will not need to deal with the channels directly though, since the port objects (see separate section for ports) have all the logic to connect to other ports via channels, but it can be good to know that they are there, in case you need to do something more advanced. Workflow The Workflow is a special object in SciPipe, that just takes care of running a set of components making up a workflow. There is not much to say about the workflow component, other than that it is created with scipipe.NewWorkflow(workflowName, maxConcurrentTasks) , that all processes need to be added to it with wf.AddProc(proc) while the \"last\", or \"driving\" process needs to be specified with wf.SetDriver(driverProcess) , and that it should be run with wf.Run() . But this is already covered in the other examples and tutorials. See GoDoc for Workflow Shell command pattern The Process has the speciality that it can be configured using a special shell command pattern, supplied to the NewProc() factory function. It is already explained in the section \"writing workflows\", but in brief, it is a normal shell command, with placeholders for in-ports, out-ports and parameter ports, on the form {i:inportname} , {o:outportname} , and {p:paramportname} , respectively.

After this, you will be able to use Go's go run command to run SciPipe workflows. Install Go Install Go by following the instructions on this page , for your operating system. Install SciPipe There are two main ways of installing SciPipe, one which is maximally easy, and one which is recommended if you want to make sure that your workflow will never break because of API changes in SciPipe, and that you always have a copy of the SciPipe source code available. Easiest: Using go get The easiest way to intsall SciPipe is by using the go get tool in the Go tool chain. To install scipipe with go get , run the following command in your terminal: go get github.com/scipipe/scipipe/... N.B: Don't miss the ... , as otherwise the scipipe helper tool will not be installed. For maximum future proofing: Use a copy of SciPipe's source code in your own code In order to make sure that your workflow will never break because of API changes in SciPipe, and that you always have a copy of the SciPipe source code available, we recommend to always include a copy of the SciPipe source code in your workflow's source code repository. The SciPipe source code is only around 1500 lines of code, with no external dependencies except Go and Bash, so this should not increase the size of your repository too much. A simple way to do this, is to clone a copy of the SciPipe source code into a folder structure that looks like this, under your main workflow code folder (where you store your own .go files): vendor/src/github.com/scipipe/scipipe To create and clone the scipipe repo to this folder, you can use these commands: mkdir -p vendor/src/github.com/scipipe cd vendor/src/github.com/scipipe git clone https://github.com/scipipe/scipipe.git Initialize a new workflow file Now, you should be able to write code like in the example below, in files ending with .go . The easiest way to get started is to let the scipipe tool generate a starting point for you: scipipe new myfirstworkflow.go ... which you can then edit to your liking. Run your workflow To run a .go file, use go run : go run myfirstworkflow.go Some tips about editors In order to be productive with SciPipe, you will also need a Go editor or IDE with support for auto-completion, sometimes also called \"intellisense\". We can warmly recommend to use one of these editors, sorted by level of endorsement: Visual Studio Code with the Go plugin - If you want a very powerful almost IDE-like editor The vim-go plugin by Fatih - if you are a Vim power-user, or need a terminal-only complement to VSCode. JetBrain's GoLand IDE , if you are ready to pay for maximum code intelligence in a professional IDE. LiteIDE - if you want a simple, robust and fast standalone Go-editor.

NewProc ( hello , echo Hello {o:out} ) hello . SetOut ( out , hello.txt ) world := wf . NewProc ( world , echo $(cat {i:in}) World {o:out} ) world . SetOut ( out , {i:in|%.txt}_world.txt ) // Connect network world . In ( in ). From ( hello . Out ( out )) // Run workflow wf . Run () } Now let's go through the code example in some detail, to see what we are actually doing. Initializing processes // Initialize processes from shell command patterns hello := sp . NewProc ( hello , echo Hello {o:out} ) world := sp . NewProc ( world , echo $(cat {i:in}) World {o:out} ) Here we are initializing two new processes, both of them based on a shell command, using the scipipe.NewProc() function, which takes a processname, and a shell command pattern as input. The shell command pattern The shell command patterns, in this case echo 'Hello ' {o:out} and echo $(cat {i:in}) World {o:out} , are basically normal bash shell commands, with the addition of \"placeholders\" for input and output filenames. Input filename placeholders are on the form {i:INPORT-NAME} and the output filename placeholders are similarly of the form {o:OUTPORT-NAME} . These placeholders will be replaced with actual filenames when the command is executed later. The reason that it a port-name is used to name them, is that files will be queued on the channel connecting to the port, and for each set of files on in-ports, a command will be created and executed whereafter new files will be pulled in on the out-ports, and so on. Formatting output file paths Now we need to provide some way for scipipe to figure out a suitable file name for each of the files propagating through the \"network\" of processes. This can be done using special convenience methods on the processes, starting with SetOut... . There are a few variants, of which two of them are shown here. // Configure output file path formatters for the processes created above hello . SetOut ( out , hello.txt ) world . SetOut ( out , {i:in|%.txt}_world.txt ) SetOut takes a pattern similar to the shell command pattern, with placeholders, used to define new (shell-based) processes. The available placeholders that can be used are: {i:INPORTNAME} , {p:PARAMNAME} and {t:TAGNAME} . An example of a full pattern might be: {i:foo}.replace_with_{p:replacement}.txt , but can also be used for simple, static paths, like in the example above. The placeholders can also take certain extra commands, separated from the placeholder name by pipe characters, and of which the one used above is probably the most important one: %STRING . It will remove the specified string from the end of the path, which is useful when we want to avoid getting too long paths when re-using previous processes' paths. With the example above, our input file named hello.txt will be converted into hello_world.txt by this path pattern. Even more control over file formatting We can actually get even more control over how file names are produced than this, by manually supplying each process with an anonymous function that returns file paths given a scipipe.Task object, which will be produced for each command execution. In order to implement the same path patterns as above, using this method, we would write like this: // Configure output file path formatters for the processes created above hello . SetOutFunc ( out , func ( t * sp . Task ) string { return hello.txt }) world . SetOutFunc ( out , func ( t * sp . Task ) string { return strings . Replace ( t . InPath ( in ), .txt , _world.txt , - 1 ) }) As you can see, this is a much more complicated way to format paths, but it can be useful for example when needing to incorporate parameter values into file names. A caveat about using variables in anonymous functions Note that when using anonymous functions, you have to be careful to not re-use the same variable (even with different values) in multiple functions, due to the subtle ways in which closures work in Go . For example, if you create multiple new processes with separate formatting functions in a loop, that uses a shared variable, like this: for _ , val := range [] string { foo , bar } { proc := scipipe . NewProc ( val + _proc , cat {p:val} {o:out} ) proc . SetOutFunc ( out , func ( t * sp . Task ) string { return val + .txt }) } ... then, both functions will return \"bar.txt\", since both funcs were pointing to the same variable (\"var\"), which had the value \"bar\" at the end of the loop. To avoid this situation, you can do one of two things, of which the latter is generally recommended: 1. Create a new copy of the variable, inside the anonymous function: for _ , val := range [] string { foo , bar } { proc := scipipe . NewProc ( val + _proc , cat {p:val} {o:out} ) val := val // - Here we create a new copy of the variable proc . SetOutFunc ( out , func ( t * sp . Task ) string { return val + .txt }) } 2. ... or, better, access the parameter value via the task which the path function receives: for _ , val := range [] string { foo , bar } { proc := scipipe . NewProc ( val + _proc , cat {p:val} {o:out} ) proc . SetOutFunc ( out , func ( t * sp . Task ) string { return t . Param ( val ) + .txt // Access param via the task (`t`) }) } Connecting processes into a network Finally we need to define the data dependencies between our processes. We do this by connecting the outports of one process to the inport of another process, using the From method available on each in-port object (Or the To method on out-ports). We also need to connect the final out-port of the pipeline to the workflow, so that the workflow can pull on this port (technically pulling on a Go channel), in order to drive the workflow. // Connect network world . In ( in ). From ( helloWriter . Out ( out )) Running the pipeline So, the final part probably explains itself, but the workflow component is a relatively simple one that will start each component in a separate go-routine. For technical reasons, one final process has to be run in the main go-routine (that where the program's main() function runs), but generally you don't need to think about this, as the workflow will then use an in-built sink process for this purpose. If you for any reason need to customize which process to use as the \"driver\" process, instead of the in-built sink. see the SetDriver section in the docs. wf . Run () Summary So with this, we have done everything needed to set up a file-based batch workflow system. In summary, what we did, was to: Initialize processes For each out-port, define a file-naming strategy Specify dependencies by connecting out- and in-ports Run the pipeline This actually turns out to be a fixed set of components that always need to be included when writing workflows, so it might be good to keep them in mind and memorize these steps, if needed.

SciPipe does not provide one unified way to handle parameters, but instead suggest a few different strategies, dependent on the usage pattern. This is because it turns out that there is a very large variety in how parameters can be used with shell commands. To keep SciPipe a small and flexible tool, we instead mostly leave the choice up to the workflow author to create a solution for each case, using a few helper tools provided with SciPipe, but also all the programming facilities built in to the Go programming language. Below we will discuss how to handle the most common uses for for parameters in SciPipe. For any more complicated use cases not covered here, please refer to the mailing list or the chat , to ask your question. Static parameters If parameters in your shell command is always, the same, you can just add them \"manually\" to the shell command pattern used to create your process. For example, if you always want to write the string \"hello\" to output files, you could create your processes with this string added manually: helloWriter := scipipe . NewProc ( helloWriter , echo hello {o:outfile} ) See also Static parameters example Receive parameters dynamically Receiving parameters dynamically is a much more technically demandning solution than using static parameters. The idea is that by using placeholders for parameter values in a command, each parameter for a particular process, will automatically get a channel of type string, on which it can receive values. When the process is ready to execute another shell command, it receives one item on each parameter ports, in addition to receiving one file on each (file-)in-port, and merges the values into the shell command, before executing it. An example of this would be a little too complicated to cover briefly on this page, so please instead see the dynamic parameters example . In the Run method of the Combinatorics task you will find the code used to send values (all combinations of values in three arrays of lenght 3, in this case).

The idea is that by using placeholders for parameter values in a command, each parameter for a particular process, will automatically get a channel of type string, on which it can receive values. When the process is ready to execute another shell command, it receives one item on each parameter ports, in addition to receiving one file on each (file-)in-port, and merges the values into the shell command, before executing it. An example of this would be a little too complicated to cover briefly on this page, so please instead see the dynamic parameters example .

This can be useful especially if you are doing modifications far up in an already developed workflow, and want to run only up to a specific process, rather than also running all downstream processes, which might be unnecessary heavy. This can be done by using the workflow.RunTo() method. By using this instead of the normal workflow.Run() method, scipipe will only run this process and all upstream processes of that one. See also a simple example of where this is used. There are a few other variants for specifying parts of workflows (and more might be added in the future), such as specifying individual process names, or providing the process structs themselves. Please refer to the relevant parts of the workflow documentation for more about that.","title":"Running parts of workflows"},{"location":"howtos/plot_workflow_graph/","text":"SciPipe 0.8.0 introduced a feature to plot a directed graph of workflows in SciPipe [1]. This can be done in two ways: Just producing a DOT text file, with the graph definition Also converting this DOT file to PDF. Number 1. above can be done without any external dependencies, while number 2 requires that graphviz, with the dot command is installed on the system (On Ubuntu it can be installed with the command: sudo apt-get install graphviz ). How to plot graphs To write a .dot file in SciPipe, include a line like follows, in your workflow definition, provided that you have initiated the variable wf with a workflow struct: func main () { wf := scipipe . NewWorkflow ( my workflow , 4 ) // Workflow code here wf . PlotGraph ( my_workflow_graph.dot ) // -- SEE THIS LINE! wf .

In order for components in such a library to be easy to use, the ports need to be static methods bound to the process struct, rather than just stored by a string ID in a generic port map, like the In() and Out() methods on Process processes. This is so that the methods can show up in the auto-completion / intellisense function in code editors removing the need to look up the name of the ports manually in the library code all the time. How to create re-usable components in SciPipe Process processes created with the scipipe.NewProc() command, can be turned into such \"re-usable\" component by using a wrapping strategy, that is demonstrated in an example on GitHub . The idea is to create a new struct type for the re-usable component, and then, in the factory method for the process, create an \"inner\" process of type Process, using NewProc() as in the normal case, embedding that in the outer struct and then adding statically defined accessor methods for each of the ports in the inner process, with a similar name. So, if the inner process has an outport named \"foo\", you would define an accessor method named myproc.OutFoo() that returns this port from the inner process. Let's look at a code example of how this works, by creating a process that just writes \"hi\" to a file: type HiWriter struct { // Embedd a Process struct * sci . Process } func NewHiWriter () * HiWriter { // Initialize a normal Process to use as an inner process innerHiWriter := sci . NewProc ( hiwriter , echo hi {o:hifile} ) innerHiWriter .
